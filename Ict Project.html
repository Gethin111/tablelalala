<h3> ICT Project </h3>
    </herder> 
<p>Our ICT project was to create an ICt-related blog site whose main function is to ask, answer and discuss questions. Users of the site can create a topic for a specific ICT issue, and users who see the topic can then answer the question or discuss it with other users within the topic.
</p>
      
<h1> How was the site created?
</h1>
<p>The first step: Discovery Phase, because the company believes that the blog website has the development space, the future has the larger prospect, so we choose it.
</p>
 <p>The second step:planning,ICT blog sites require some planning and planning before they are created, and the general direction must be known.
</p>
<p>The third step:Design,Website design is very important, will directly affect the accessibility of the website, so the content of the website is clear and clear, not too redundant and complex, text content size is set to be larger, in line with normal viewing needs, and button Settings will be larger, not too small.We use Dreamweaver to design the site
</P>
<p>The fourth step:Development,Because the development stage of a website is very long, it is necessary to achieve a general understanding of the situation of the relevant people, such as customers, and the site should be constantly tested, constantly reviewed to meet the requirements.
</P>
<p>The fifth step:Launching the Website,After a long development phase, the site should be ready for use, and there should be a lot of preparatory work, such as making lists.
</p>
<p>The sixth step:Maintenance,After the site is put into use, a lot of maintenance is needed for the site, because the site will inevitably appear some bugs or some artificial attacks.
</p>
<p>Below is a diagram of the website design:

<p>The process of using the site device for transmission: The site and network services are put into use by the company, therefore, the site used by the company is provided by the company's server. And set up the router, the router's role is to enables the equipment to receive the network and can be used for each equipment, the router set up in the process of receiving and provide network to set up a firewall, the establishment of a firewall is to prevent the virus invasion, or various man-made attack, the final transfer to every user of the equipment, such as: PCS, tablets, laptops, servers, printers, etc. Here is the relationship chart:</p>
